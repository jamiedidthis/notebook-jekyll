Staying with the Trouble: Making Kin in the Chthulucene (Experimental Futures)
[[Donna Haraway]]

Drawing from the Greek roots khthon (earth) and kainos ([[time]]), Haraway coins Chthulucene as an alternative to the monikers [[Anthropocene]] or Capitalocene as labels for these turbulent times. 

> The Anthropocene marks severe discontinuities; what comes after will not be like what came before. I think our job is to make the Anthropocene as short/thin as possible and to cultivate with each other in every way imaginable epochs to come that can replenish refuge.

She proposes a radically different worldview, once that is based in [[Science fiction futures|science fictional behavior]] and achievable in the face of current devastations. (Haraway uses the acronym SF throughout her book and traces its possible meanings: “science fiction, speculative fabulation, string figures, speculative feminism, science fact, so far…”)

She references, among others, Ursula K. LeGuin (The Author of the Acacia Seeds) and Octavia Butler (Parable of the Sower) for their visionary exploration of narrative and biological sympoiesis. Whatever the future holds, the human and nonhuman are inextricably linked in tentacular practices, and will require sym-poiesis, or making-with, rather than auto-poiesis, or self-making.

Learning to stay with the trouble of living and dying together on a damaged earth will prove more conducive to the kind of thinking that would provide the means to building more livable futures.
